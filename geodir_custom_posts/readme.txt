GeoDirectory Custom Post Types allows to create multiple custom post types as you need, allowing you to divide categories and manage features and parameters per CPT.

== Description ==

Managing a large diverse directory just got way easier. Harness the full power of WordPress custom post types (CPT) to offer and manage multiple listing categories.

Here's how it works: each new listing you make with GeoDirectory is a custom post. By default, GeoDirectory offers a single custom post type, called "Places". This add-on lets you create and add as many CPT's as you need, allowing you to divide categories and manage features and parameters per CPT.

Each CPT has its own form builder, so you can add in any custom fields, prices, custom categories and tags that you need. You can even create listings without a physical location and build a directory of websites or online services.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'geodir_custom_posts' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin "GeoDirectory Custom Post Types" through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to WordPress Admin -> GeoDirectory -> Settings -> Post Types and customize behaviour as needed
4. For detailed setup instructions, visit the official [Documentation](https://wpgeodirectory.com/documentation/article/category/custom-post-types-extension/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=installation_tab&utm_content=documentation&utm_campaign=readme) page.
