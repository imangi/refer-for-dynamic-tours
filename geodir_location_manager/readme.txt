GeoDirectory Location Manager allows you to expand your directory and go global by creating unlimited locations for your listings.

== Description ==

Why the Location Manager?

Because if your directory website cover more than one city, you'll need the Location Manager Add-on.

The Core Plugin that we offer for free on WordPress.org, allows to submit listings only within 1 location (City, Town or Village).

With the Location Manager, you can expand your directory and go global! With the GeoDirectory Locations Manager add-on you can create unlimited locations for your listings.

Obviously there is no need to create all the locations in advance. Users can add new locations while adding a new listing. We query the Google Maps API to do so.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'geodir_location_manager' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin "GeoDirectory Location Manager" through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to WordPress Admin -> GeoDirectory -> Settings -> Locations and customize behaviour as needed
