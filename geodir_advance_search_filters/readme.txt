GeoDirectory Advanced Search Filters plugin allows to expands the default GeoDirectory search functionality by adding a range of filters.

== Description ==

The GeoDirectory Advanced Search Filters plugin expands the default GeoDirectory search widget by adding a range of filters such as:
- Search Autocompleter
- GeoLocation
- Proximity Search
- Radius Search
- Filter by any custom field

The possibilities are limitless and your users will love their Advanced Search experience.

The Advanced Search add-on enables Ajax Autocompleter function to both of GeoDirectory search fields: "Search For" and "Near".

The "Search For" field will search for keywords in the listing title, text content, categories and tags.

While the "Near" field will query locations and return results sorted by distance.

== Installation ==
